# DataScience--PythonProjects
This repository contains set of projects for Data Science beginners using Python.

### PROJECT 1 (A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners)
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way.
We'll find out- What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice? 
The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle.

### PROJECT 2 (Analyze TV Data)
For this set of project, we will use a combination of data manipulation and visualization to explore television data. In this project, we will look at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows.  
Packages used- Matplotlib, seaborn, pandas

### Project 3 (Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing)
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
Reanalyse the data behind one of the most important discoveries of modern medicine: handwashing.

### Project 4 (Predicting Credit Card Approvals)
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, we build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### PROJECT 5 (Pubg)
In this project, few questions are answered using the above same packages  
TASKS PERFORMED:
1. Read the dataset.
2. Check the datatype of all the columns.
3. Find the summary of all the numerical columns and write your findings about it.
4. The average person kills how many players?
5. 99% of people have how many kills?
6. The most kills ever recorded are how much?
7. Print all the columns of the dataframe.
8. Comment on distribution of the match's duration. Use seaborn.
9. Comment on distribution of the walk distance. Use seaborn.
10. Plot distribution of the match's duration vs walk distance one below the other.
11. Plot distribution of the match's duration vs walk distance side by side.
12. Pairplot the dataframe. Comment on kills vs damage dealt, Comment on maxPlace vs numGroups.
13. How many unique values are there in 'matchType' and what are their counts?
14. Plot a barplot of ‘matchType’ vs 'killPoints'. Write your inferences.
15. Plot a barplot of ‘matchType’ vs ‘weaponsAcquired’. Write your inferences.
16. Find the Categorical columns.
17. Plot a boxplot of ‘matchType’ vs ‘winPlacePerc’. Write your inferences.
18. Plot a boxplot of ‘matchType’ vs ‘matchDuration’. Write your inferences.
19. Change the orientation of the above plot to horizontal.
20. Add a new column called ‘KILL’ which contains the sum of following columns viz. headshotKills, teamKills, roadKills.
21. Round off column ‘winPlacePerc’ to 2 decimals.
22. Take a sample of size 50 from the column damageDealt for 100 times and calculate its mean. Plot it on a histogram and comment on its distribution.

### PROJECT 6 (The Android App Market on Google Play)
A comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.  
The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website.

### Project 7 (The GitHub History of the Scala Language)
Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, we'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

### Project 8 (Bitcoin Price Prediction)
Real-time project where we collect data, explore it, clean it and finally come up with a predictive model with the right features to predict the future prices of the bitcoins.

### Project 9 (COVID-19 Analysis)
With the exponential increase in the rates of COVID_19 positive cases, here's a small visualization to understand it and to predict the number of cases in future.

### Project 10 (Stock Price Prediction)
Using linear regression algorithm to find the best fit line based on past data. The model is trained further to predict future price as well.
